# Wow! Super Hero Landing!
## Welcome!
## About Myself
- 👋 I’m Jinming Zhang.
- 👀 I’m interested in game development, teach me rigging :3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and OpenGL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some fun relaxing game jams
- 📫 You can reach me at: jinming.zhang47@gmail.com
  
## Projects:
#### [Furry Wolf Engine](https://github.com/Jinming-Zhang/FurryWolfEngine)

This is my personal on-going project with the goal of learning and practicing mordern C++, OpenGL, and various programming techniques such as design patterns, multi-threading, etc..

###### Planned stages of *Furry Wolf Engine*:
- Implement features listed in the *FABULOUS* [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) website with a basic game engine structure, learn techniques of OpenGL `<- Current Stage :)`
- Practce Valgrind and make the code base memory leak free.
- Implement multi-threading for rendering passes.
- Refactor code into modules that can be exported and used as an simple game engine back end core.
- Create a front end graphical user interface that uses the game engine api to create simple games. (Language to be decided...)
- Implement a simple audio system.
- Implement or import a physics system.
- A pretty big plan already :). Hope I can get here one day!

#### Gamejams
I do participate in a few game jams every year to try out new things, such as:
- Practicing Unreal Engine 5.
- Making model with Blender.
- Play with cinemachine and timelines in Unity.
- Tryout different design patterns like strategy, object pooling, service locator etc.

Sadly I'm not planing on using Unity for personal projects anymore due to their Run Time Fee policy. It's no longer a game engine I can and want to trust.

I'm switching to Godot and Unreal, so in the next game jam I'm planning to make a game in Godot!

Games I made for game jams [can be found at itch.io.](https://wolffurry.itch.io/)

#### Portfolio
Yes, I wantted to be a web developer.

Instead of making a website using existing template, I learned ReactJS and SASS to build front-end, NodeJS to build back-end and connect with third party APIs to send emails, AWS and Nginx to host the website to the public, and developed my portfolio website by myself!

The consequence to let a programmer build a website from scratch? **IT LOOKS AWEFUL xD!!**

If you think you have a strong mental power, cast protective spells on your eyes and [GO AHEAD!](https://jinming.ca)
